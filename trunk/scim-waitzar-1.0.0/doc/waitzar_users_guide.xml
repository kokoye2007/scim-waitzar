    <title>Introduction to SCIM and WaitZar</title>
    <para>
      If you're a Linux user who knows how to write a complex script like Chinese or Thai, chances are you've used SCIM before.
      Even some European users prefer SCIM, although their languages do not require such a complex solution. 
      The <command>scim-waitzar</command> project extends SCIM to support the Myanmar language.

    <para>
      WaitZar is a romanisation of Burmese designed specifically for fast typing on a standard keyboard. Given the fluid nature of the 
      Myanmar unicode specification (i.e., the 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1 encodings are mutually incompatible) and the wide variety of <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> 
      encodings (e.g., Zawgyi-One partial, Win Innwa's ASCII kludging, etc.), WaitZar provides a degree of solidity and flexibility above and 
      beyond that provided by most other input schemes for Burmese.

     <title>Requirements &amp; Installation</title>
     <para>
    WaitZar will run on almost any Linux distribution that also supports SCIM. In fact, by installing the <command>scim</command> package 
    (or building SCIM from source), you should already have everything you need. WaitZar is recommended for Ubuntu Linux, but it has also 
    been tested on Debian Linux. Please inform us if <command>scim-waitzar</command> works (or breaks!) on your favorite brand of Linux.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Unlike the Windows version, WaitZar under Linux requires a significant amount of installation effort. The most stable method is to build 
    <command>scim-waitzar</command> from source; see Section 2.3. However, a great many build steps are simplified if your system supports 
    Debian packages. See Section 2.1 if you're used to using apt-get, and Section 2.2 if you'd prefer to (manually) use dpkg. 
    Finally, Section 2.4 explains several very important things to consider after installation (using any of the three methods.) 
    Until WaitZar gets fully integrated into Ubuntu's <emphasis>Language</emphasis> manager, you will have to consider these. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
    You should have at least one of the following Unicode 5.1-enabled fonts installed on your system. 
    Please see Section 2.4 for more information on how to install fonts.

    </itemizedlist>
    <literallayout>You should install one of these fonts (for example, <command>ttf-sil-padauk</command>) in order to view this document properly.</literallayout>

    <note>
      <title>Note Regarding Fonts</title>
      <para>Traditionally, Burmese fonts have defined their own <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> encodings, which has caused a lot of confusion
      among novice computer users and experts alike. Even previous versions of the Unicode encoding (for example, 4.0 and 5.0) had non-negligible errors 
      and incompatibilities. Fortunately, Unicode 5.1 has resolved most of these, and the three fonts listed all render this document with no errors.
      </para>
      
      <para>Developers, please note that, when discussing character encoding incompatibilities (in, say, the "Wait Zar User Interface Specification"), the documentation will
      use the Zawgyi-One font &amp; encoding, due to its unambiguous representation of variant forms.
      </para>
    </note>

    <section>
      <title>Installation Using Apt</title>
      <para>The recommended way of installing WaitZar is to use <command>apt-get</command> or the Syanptic Package Manager. 
      In order to do this, you will have to add a line to the sources file. To do this, open a console and type:
      <programlisting>gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.lst</programlisting>
      ...and add the following repository lines at the very end. Note that these links are temporary. After we finish alpha testing, we'll put the 
      <command>scim-waitzar</command> package at a more suitable location.
      <programlisting>deb http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sethhetu/scim_wz_1.0.0/ ./
deb-src http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sethhetu/scim_wz_1.0.0/ ./</programlisting>
      ...then, save the file and close <command>gedit</command>, and type:
      <programlisting>sudo apt-get update</programlisting>
      This will update the list of packages. Finally, install <command>scim-waitzar</command>:
      <programlisting>sudo apt-get install scim-waitzar</programlisting>
      Of course, you can also use Synaptic at this point:
      
        <figure><title>After reloading your repositories, you can simply install WaitZar like any other package.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/synaptic_loading_waitzar.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>

    <section>
      <title>Installing the .deb File Directly</title>
      <para>In general, the apt repository will never go offline. Nevertheless, you can always download and install the .deb package manually. 
        Grab the latest version from:
      <literallayout><ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/scim-waitzar/downloads/list"/></literallayout>
      ...and the latest version of libwaitzar from:
      <literallayout><ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/waitzar/downloads/list"/></literallayout>
      ...and then run the standard <command>dpkg</command> install command:
      <programlisting>sudo dpkg -i libwaitzar_*.deb scim-waitzar_*.deb</programlisting>
      ...from the directory you downloaded the package to. You must then restart X (log out, log in). In case you are not familiar with 
      <command>dpkg</command>, note that un-installation can be done from any directory, and requires only the logical name of the 
      package:
      <programlisting>sudo dpkg -r scim-waitzar</programlisting>

      <title>Building &amp; Installing from Source</title>
      <para>Building from source is actually quite simple, thanks to the GNU autotools. Here are the steps for the Ubuntu operating system, although 
      they should work with any <command>automake</command>-compatible system. These instructions are for the "developer hat", since users will 
      probably just use <command>apt-get</command> to install WaitZar. If you are wearing your "user hat", you should still be able to follow along.

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Install necessary packages, preferably with <command>apt-get</command>:
	      <programlisting>sudo apt-get install subversion autoconf automake gettext libtool scim-dev g++ libwaitzar-dev</programlisting>
	      If apt cannot find libwaitzar-dev, you can build and install that from source as well, using instructions similar to those provided in this section.
            </para>
          </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Make a directory for the source files, and download them with <command>svn</command>:

      <title>Fonts &amp; Configuration Extras</title>
      <para>Although most Linux programs have been properly internationalized, a great many users simply do not trust &ldquo;tacking another layer&rdquo; 
      onto input (that layer being SCIM). Hence, simply installing WaitZar will not be enough &mdash;you'll also have to enable it, play around with 
      <command>fontconfig</command>, and probably install some fonts, too. Here are some helpful hints and tricks. It should go without saying that, 
      although these techniques are harmless, we take no responsibility for any unintentional side effects they have on your system.
      </para>
      
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Enable Chinese</emphasis> &mdash; Making every application recognize SCIM is not easy; there are reports that 
      &ldquo;SCIM won't work in Open Office&rdquo; which are only half true. Fortunately, there's a cheap trick that works well in Ubuntu: just enable Chinese, and 
      the system will figure all this out for you. Click on &ldquo;System&rdquo; then &ldquo;Administration&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Language Support&rdquo;, 
      and check the box marked &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo;. 
      Several package files will be installed. Finally, check the box that reads &ldquo;Enable support to enter complex characters&rdquo;, and click &ldquo;Ok&rdquo;. 
      You will probably have to restart. Note that, if you do not have at least one complex language installed (like Chinese), checking the box will have no 
      effect. That is why we recommend enabling Chinese, specifically.
       
        <figure><title>The &ldquo;Language Support&rdquo; window. Make sure the &ldquo;complex characters&rdquo; checkbox is checked.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/ubuntu_enabling_chinese.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
      </para>
      
      
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Finagle FontConfig</emphasis> &mdash; SCIM does not dictate which font should be used for its main interface, 
      relying on <emphasis>fontconfig</emphasis> like every other program does. That means the wrong font can be picked for the wrong encoding. 
      For example, here is what WaitZar looks like if Zawgyi-One is chosen by mistake.
      
        <figure><title>Trying to type &ldquo;kote&rdquo; with a mis-configured font selector. Note that this will not actually affect the typed word, just the list of choices.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/zawgyi_rendering_kote.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
	
        We recommend listing at least one Unicode 5.1 font in local.conf's &ldquo;prefer&rdquo; tags. We've created a sample file for you that also makes your text sharper, and has 
	Chinese fonts listed properly. You can get it here:
	<literallayout><ulink url="http://scim-waitzar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/local.conf"/></literallayout>
	...copy it to 
	<programlisting>/etc/fonts/local.conf </programlisting>
	...using, for example:
	<programlisting>cd /etc/fonts &amp;&amp; sudo cp local.conf  local.bak
sudo wget http://scim-waitzar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/local.conf</programlisting>
        You'll probably have to restart X. (Log out/Log in).
      </para>
      
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Install Some Fonts</emphasis> &mdash; You'll need at least one font installed to use WaitZar effectively. 
      Some fonts have packages to make installation easier; for example, the <emphasis>Padauk</emphasis> font has <command>ttf-sil-padauk</command>. 
      If no package exists, you have several options. The simplest is to make a user-level fonts directory:
      <programlisting>mkdir ~/.fonts</programlisting>
      ...and then copy any fonts you download to that folder. You should not have to restart X, but you might need to restart any running application 
      you want to use the font in.

    <title>Basic Usage</title>
    
    <section>
      <title>Introduction to SCIM</title>
      <para>After you install <command>scim-waitzar</command>, you should take some time to get used to SCIM's unique feel. You will see a 
      small keyboard-shaped icon in your tray, right-click it, and choose &ldquo;SCIM Setup&rdquo;. This panel can be quite confusing for new users, 
      so we'll briefly cover it here.
      </para>
      
      <para>The &ldquo;Front End <property>&rarr;</property> Global Setup&rdquo; panel contains SCIM's hotkeys, and various global settings. You will probably want to 
      change the hotkey from Ctrl+Space to <emphasis>anything</emphasis> else, if you are a programmer. 
      
        <figure><title>The SCIM setup window.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/scim_setup_page1.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
      </para>
      
      <para>The next section (IMEngine) has settings for each &ldquo;Input Method Engine&rdquo;. Recalling that SCIM provides support for 
      multiple languages, it makes sense that each language should have its own customizations. The final section, &ldquo;Panel <property>&rarr;</property> GTK&rdquo;, holds 
      most of the visual settings for SCIM. I recommend changing the &ldquo;Show&rdquo; option (under &ldquo;Toolbar&rdquo;) to &ldquo;Always&rdquo;, 
      at least until you get used to how SCIM behaves. Note that when you click &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; to exit the setup panel, SCIM will warn you that you 
      might need to restart SCIM for any changes to take place. The sure-fire way to do this is to log out and then log in again. Optionally, you 
      might right-click on the SCIM icon and choose &ldquo;Reload Configuration&rdquo;. In some cases, the operating system will reload SCIM for you. 
      Regardless, you won't be playing around with the WaitZar settings that much anyway.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Typing Your First Myanmar Sentence</title>
      <para>After configuring SCIM just the way you like it, start <command>gedit</command> and then look at the lower-right corner of your screen. 
      You'll see the SCIM toolbar; move the mouse over it and it will expand to show that you are typing in Englihsh. Click on the language and choose 
      &ldquo;Burmese&rdquo; to switch to WaitZar. (Note that if this panel is hidden, you can always click on the SCIM icon in your tray to switch to Burmese.) 
      Then, type &ldquo;ko&rdquo;. You will see two possibilities presented to you. You will also see the word &ldquo;<inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_ko.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">&#x1000;&#x102D;&#x102F;</foreignphrase>&rdquo; 
      inside of <command>gedit</command>. This is one of the nice features of WaitZar on Linux: you can keep your eyes on the document you are typing, and 
      only have to look at the list of choices when something doesn't match.
      
        <figure><title>Choosing between two "ko"s.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/ko_first_sentence.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
      </para>
      
      <para>Hit &ldquo;space&rdquo;, and the cursor will move right; the list of choices will disappear. Now, type &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and you will see the 
      Burmese numeral &ldquo;<foreignphrase>&#x1042;</foreignphrase>&rdquo;. Finally, hit &ldquo;Enter&rdquo;, and the words you typed will no longer be 
      underlined. Why did this happen? Basically, WaitZar &ldquo;pre-edits&rdquo; anything you type. Hitting left and right works correctly in WaitZar 
      because it delays direct typing of words. Although this may take some getting used to, it is actually quite natural, and there are several shortcuts to 
      save you time. 
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Additional WaitZar Hotkeys</title>
      <para>By default, SCIM lets you switch to the <emphasis>last</emphasis> language you used by hitting Ctrl+Space. 
      Hitting it again will switch to English.
      </para>
      
      <para>When you are typing in WaitZar, several other hotkeys also take effect:
        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	  <listitem><para>Pressing any letter will type that letter, and attempt to form a word.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Pressing left and right will move the cursor. When you are typing a word, left and right 
	                              switch between the various choices.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; will confirm the typed sentence. If you are typing a word, hitting &ldquo;enter&rdquo; is the same 
	                              as hitting &ldquo;space&rdquo;.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Pressing &ldquo;space&rdquo; will move the cursor right. If the cursor is all the way to the right, hitting &ldquo;space&rdquo; will 
	                              confirm the typed sentence. When you are typing a word, hitting &ldquo;space&rdquo; will choose the 
				      currently-selected choice.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Hitting the number keys (0-9) will type the burmese numeral (<foreignphrase>&#x1040;&#x002D;&#x1049;</foreignphrase>). If you are typing a word, 
	                              hitting a number will &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; to that word. (Try typing &ldquo;ko2&rdquo; to see this work).</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Hitting the period or comma keys will type the Burmese full or half stop characters (&ldquo;<foreignphrase>&#x104A;</foreignphrase>&rdquo; 
	                              and &ldquo;<foreignphrase>&#x104B;</foreignphrase>&rdquo;). If you have typed part of a sentence, this will also 
				      confirm the sentence.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Hitting &ldquo;esc&rdquo; will cancel the sentence or word you are typing.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Hitting &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; and &ldquo;delete&rdquo; will function as expected, deleting letters or words depending 
	                              on the context.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>In the rare case that you are using an absolutely tiny display, hitting up and down will scroll the list of choices if there are too 
	                             many to fit on the screen at once.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>The Open Office Glitch</title>
      <para>There are several glitches related to WaitZar; most are covered in Section 5. However, one particularly nasty bit occurs in Open Office 
      Writer &ndash;to see it for yourself, change the font (in Open Office) to Padauk, type &ldquo;singapore&rdquo;, and then hit &ldquo;space&rdquo; twice 
      to finalize it. The result is a mess of glyphs:
      
        <figure><title>Open Office seems to like resetting the font for you, even when this is actually incorrect.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/open_office_glitch.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
	
      Fortunately, this is easy to fix: just select all the text and change the font to &ldquo;Padauk&rdquo; again. For some reason, Open Office reverts the 
      font to <emphasis>Bitstream Vera Sans</emphasis>, an otherwise-excellent font that, unfortunately, cannot entirely handle Burmese just yet.
      </para>
      
      <para>Even more fortunately, this only has to be done once: the first time you create a new document. Even if you delete everything on the page, 
      Open Office can still manage to change the font back to Padauk the second time you enter Burmese text. 
      </para>
      
      <para>On a side note, this glitch is far worse on Windows, which doesn't provide a reasonable catch-all font. In this case, the first Burmese word 
      you type in Open Office will actually be invisible!
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Changing the Output Encoding</title>
      <para>A great many websites use encodings that conflict with the established standard. Criticizing them will do no good; these <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis>
      encodings were all developed to suit a particular niche, and they will likely be around until the end of time. 
      </para>
      
      <para>WaitZar supports two of these encodings: the Zawgyi-One font encoding, and the Win Innwa font family encoding. (Win Kalaw, for instance, is in the 
      Win Innwa font family). To change the encoding, start typing in Burmese, and then click the &ldquo;UNI&rdquo; icon in the SCIM toolbar. Now choose the encoding you 
      want. This will reset the next time you log in; if you want to change the encoding used by default, see Section 3.6.

      <title>A Note About config.txt</title>
      <para>For Windows users of WaitZar, it should come as a mildly unpleasant surprise that config.txt does nothing. The proper way to change 
      WaitZar's configuration settings is through the SCIM settings panel, on the &ldquo;WaitZar&rdquo; tab. 
      You can currently only change two settings: how Burmese numbers are typed, and the default output encoding. A screenshot of this panel follows.
 
        <figure><title>WaitZar's settings: here, the user has chosen to type numbers in Burmese, and to start WaitZar with Zawgyi-One by default.</title>

   <section>
      <title>Adding custom words to mywords.txt</title>
      <para>WaitZar's dictionary is drawn from online forums, books, and news articles, and it contains most of the words needed by most of the users. However,
      it is possible that you may find it lacking a word you need. Or, you might type a word so often (like your name) that you want to shorten it. For this,
      you will add lines to the file "mywords.txt" of the form:
      <programlisting>myanmar = roman</programlisting>
      For example:
      <programlisting><foreignphrase>မ</foreignphrase> = ma</programlisting>
      Note that, for legacy reasons, you will have to enter the word you require in the Zawgyi-One encoding. If you have the word in a different encoding,
      the following web site provides excellent software for converting it:
      <literallayout><ulink url="http://burglish.googlepages.com/fontconv.htm"/></literallayout>
      </para>
      
      <para>The only remaining detail is <emphasis>which</emphasis> mywords.txt file to edit. For global changes to WaitZar, you can change 
      /usr/share/scim-waitzar/mywords.txt. For user-level changes, you should change ~/.scim-waitzar/mywords.txt. The latter way is preferred. 
      You should use the UTF-8 encoding for this file; for example:
      <programlisting>mkdir -p ~/.scim-waitzar

    <title>Finding a Word</title>
    <para>Although WaitZar was designed to be natural to use, there will come a time when you do not know how to type a word in WaitZar. 
    Fortunately, as of release 1.6 on Windows (and 1.0.0 on Linux), WaitZar now ships with version 2.0 of the WaitZar romanisation. This romanisation was 
    designed to be simple and effective, and to make looking up unknown words easy. We will now discuss how this works.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>The WaitZar Romanisation</title>
      <para>The WaitZar romanisation was designed around three simple principles:
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>There should be a few simple rules which most words follow.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>All words should be easy to guess, even if you don’t know the rules.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Each Burmese word gets exactly one English romanisation.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      The first rule is covered in the next section (on the default romanisation), and the second rule is relevant throughout. 
      The final rule may seem silly: why not allow <inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_thar.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">&#x101E;&#x102C;</foreignphrase> = &ldquo;tar&rdquo; or &ldquo;thar&rdquo; or &ldquo;ttar&rdquo;? 
      Our main reason for enforcing this rule is efficiency. Once you learn that <inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_thar.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">&#x101E;&#x102C;</foreignphrase> = &ldquo;thar&rdquo; in WaitZar, 
      then you will start to get annoyed if you see <inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_thar.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">&#x101E;&#x102C;</foreignphrase> when you type &ldquo;tar&rdquo; or &ldquo;ttar&rdquo;. Through 
      decisions like this, we try to make our system agreeable to both novices and experts.
      </para>
      
      <section>
        <title>Default Romanisation</title>
        <para>Most Burmese words can be thought of as an onset combined with a rhyme. For example: <inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_non.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">&#x1014;&#x103D;&#x1036;</foreignphrase>, pronounced 
	&ldquo;non&rdquo;, can be broken up into <foreignphrase>&#x1014;</foreignphrase> = &ldquo;n(a)&rdquo; and <inlinegraphic scale="80" fileref="images/inline_on.png" role="pdf"/><foreignphrase role="html">-&#x103D;&#x1036;</foreignphrase> 
	= &ldquo;on&rdquo;. Words can actually be broken up further, into consonants, medials, vowels, tones, and finals, but a unique quality of onsets and rhymes is that they can 
	be spelled the same way when they appear in different words. For example:
	
        <informalfigure>
          <graphic fileref="images/table_example_onsetrhyme.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="80"/>
        </informalfigure>
       </para>
       
       <para>The rhymes always follow their phonetic pronunciation; the onsets are more structured. The following rules apply to onsets:
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>The first sound of the Myanmar letter is the Roman letter.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>If two onsets share the same first sound, the less common onset has an “h” after it. (For example: <foreignphrase>&#x1012;</foreignphrase> is “d”, but <foreignphrase>&#x1013;</foreignphrase> is “dh”)</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Rarely-used letters won't add an “h”. (For example: <foreignphrase>&#x1020;</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase>&#x100E;</foreignphrase> are both “n”, even though <foreignphrase>&#x1014;</foreignphrase> is also “n”).</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>
        
	For reference, here is the current list of rhymes and onsets. Within a rhyme, a dash indicates where onsets may be plugged in. 
	We apologize for the large size of these tables; we were forced to include them as images, since none of the Unicode-enabled fonts provides a convenient
	way for representing Burmese syllable fragments. The alternative was to require you to install the (non-compliant) Zawgyi-One font, which we felt was 
	unreasonable.

	</para>
	
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Warning:</emphasis> You may have noticed that &ldquo;<foreignphrase>&#x1021;</foreignphrase>&rdquo; is not romanised as 
	&ldquo;a&rdquo;. This is because it functions as a silent, &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; onset in spoken Burmese. Instead of typing, for example, "aa", "aone", "aote", 
	one would simply type "a", "one", or "ote". This is consistent with how most Burmese type.
	</para>
	
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Bigger Warning:</emphasis> Please be careful not to read the rhymes with an English pronunciation. For example, when typing "one",
	do <emphasis>not</emphasis> read it to sound like the English numeral 1. If you consider a consonant in front of the word (e.g., "kone") then you won't run into
	this problem.

        <title>Special Romanisations</title>
        <para>Some words don’t fall into any simple pattern, and you’ll just have to memorize them. These include pat-sint and foreign words. Also, there are six words that directly 
	contradict our onset + rhyme rule; these include “lhyo” (not “sho”) for example. The following table lists these six words, and the pat-sint words. For brevity, we do not include
	foreign words, which romanize to their foreign spelling.

        <title>Shortcuts</title>
        <para>WaitZar uses two shortcuts to speed up typing.
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>Any word containing “aung” can shorten it to simply “g”. For example, “kaung” can be typed as “kg”. 
	“Aung” by itself can be shortened to “ag”. </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>If only one set of words is possible at any point, the sequence to that set is parenthesised. For example, 
	typing “singa” is sufficient for WaitZar to guess that you want “singapore”. </para></listitem>

      </para>

    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Dictionary Lookup</title>
      <para>If, for any reason, you cannot find the word you want to type in WaitZar, you can search for it in the generated wordlist:
      <literallayout><ulink url="http://waitzar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse_project/wordlist.generated.txt"/></literallayout>
      In the future, WaitZar will allow you to search within the program itself; for now, you will have to manually look for your word. Please note that you will 
      need Zawgyi-One installed to view the generated wordlist (most development is done in Zawgyi-One to avoid ambiguity errors).

      <title>Pat-Sint Choices are Glitched</title>
      <para>Even if you follow the advice in Section 2.4, you will find that some words are still incorrect when presented as choices. 
      For example, below is a screenshot of &ldquo;singapore&rdquo; as it appears in the lookup table &ndash;note that the actual, 
      typed version is still correct.
      
        <figure><title>The Myanmar text is &ldquo;decomposed&rdquo; in SCIM, but renders correctly in Open Office.</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/glitched_patsint_rendering.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="70"/>
        </figure>
      </para>
      
      <para>The WaitZar team is uncertain as to what is causing this glitch. There are many interacting components (cairo, pango, 
      GTK, or even scim itself) that might be slightly off. Perhaps the issue is actually a fontconfig issue on our end. We 
      <emphasis>could</emphasis> solve this problem by defaulting SCIM to the Zawgyi-One font, but we feel that this solution 
      would be a cheap hack that delays the adoption of Unicode 5.1 for Burmese in Linux. Instead, we will write some test cases 
      to determine what package is causing the glitch, and then work with those developers to resolve this problem.

      <title>Alt+Tab Sometimes &ldquo;Sticks&rdquo;</title>
      <para>This appears to  be a bug in SCIM itself; under some configurations, switching to WaitZar will cause the &ldquo;Alt+Tab&rdquo; 
      combination to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; &ndash;pressing this will outline the window one is hoping to switch to, but releasing it will see you 
      at the original window; nothing happens. Clicking on any other window will cause this bug to go away until the next time you switch 
      languages.
      </para>
      
      <para>So far, we have only found one setup where this occurs, and this behavior is apparent in other IMEngines (Chinese, Thai, etc.), 
      so it is probably a bizarre case of SCIM and Linux interacting poorly. Please report this bug if you encounter it, and we will try 
      our best to narrow it down and fix it.

      <title>Choices Stuck in the Lower-Left</title>
      <para>Under some configurations (usually, the same ones described in Section 5.2), the list of choices will appear &ldquo;locked&rdquo; 
      to the lower-left of the current window. See the screenshot below for an example of this annoying bug, which makes typing very difficult. 
      Of course, you can click and drag the choices window to a more convenient location, but it will jump right back to the lower-left corner 
      as soon as you switch the language again.
      
        <figure><title>The choices window is &ldquo;sticking&rdquo; to the corner of gedit. This occurs with all language IMEs (Chinese is shown here).</title>
          <graphic fileref="images/lookup_table_glitch.png" align="center" valign="middle" scale="50"/>
        </figure>
      </para>
      
      <para>We might try re-positioning the choices window to somewhere nicer when WaitZar gets a &ldquo;focus_in()&rdquo; message, but seeing as how this is tied 
      in to the previous bug, we decided not to hack around it until we were sure it couldn't be fixed normally.

      <title>The Console Looks Glitchy</title>

        </figure>
      </para>
      
      <para>If this is what you see when you try to type WaitZar in the console, there's no need a file a bug 
      report; we're aware. If you actually see proper Burmese, then <emphasis>please</emphasis> let us know how 
      to configure the console to make this work. (<emphasis role="bold"><emphasis>Note:</emphasis></emphasis> 
      using Zawgyi-One or Win Innwa is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the solution we are looking for.)

    <para><command>scim-waitzar</command> is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, although some 
    parts of it are licensed under the Apache License v2.
    </para>
    
    <para>This means that <command>scim-waitzar</command> is Open Source, of course, and free software as well. 
    The original WaitZar on Windows is licensed under a BSD-style license; we chose to license 
    <command>scim-waitzar</command> under the GPL to make it more compatible with the GNU philosophy, and chose 
    version 3.0 to help strictly enforce that this software is not used in a non-open way.
    </para>
    
    <para>Of course, our concerns apply only to Linux, really. The WaitZar library API, available from:
      <literallayout><ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/waitzar/downloads/list"/></literallayout>
    ...contains the majority of the encapsulated functionality; both the Windows <emphasis>and</emphasis> 
    the Linux project build primarily off of this library, adding only implementation-specific code. 
    Furthermore, the library is released under the Apache License, with the intention of not forcing any 
    restrictions on developers.
