SCIM-WaitZar
---------

For users:
----------

The scim-waitzar library implements a SCIM IMEngine for Myanmar text support,
using the WaitZar romanisation and input method.

The following three output encodings are supported:
  - *Unicode 5.1 (Parabaik, Padauk, Myanmar3 fonts)
  - Zawgyi-One (version 1.0.0.12 only)
  - Win Innwa
*recommended

To customize WaitZar, please refer to the folders:
  "/usr/share/waitzar/" for all users
...and
  "~/.waitzar/: for the current user
The files "config.txt" and "mywords.txt" contain configuration properties and custom words respectively.
Please see the files in "/usr/share/waitzar/" for further documentation and examples. Note that settings and words
in "~/.waitzar/mywords.txt" will over-ride those in "/usr/share/waitzar/"

For more information, or to get involved, please see the scim-waitzar page:
  http://scim-waitzar.googlecode.com/
...or the Wait Zar page itself:

For developers:
---------------
Some developers have had trouble compiling the scim-waitzar package. If you are just a normal user, you should probably skip this section, especially if you are using Ubuntu, which manages packages for you.
If you are developing WaitZar, or if you want to build it locally, here are the commands to do so, from a CLEAN install of Ubuntu Hardy Heron.

sudo apt-get install subversion
mkdir ~/scim-waitzar
svn checkout http://scim-waitzar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scim-waitzar/ ~/scim-waitzar
cd ~/scim-waitzar
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gettext libtool
autoreconf
sudo apt-get install scim-dev
./configure
sudo apt-get install g++
make
sudo make install

You should probably go to System->Administration->Language Support and check "Enable support to enter complex characters". At this point, you can log out and log back on to see WaitZar in your scim control panel. You can run

sudo make uninstall

...and then logout/login to rever these changes (if, say, scim-waitzar is buggy.) Please contact the developers if you are having trouble compiling scim-waitzar for your system.


NOTE:
-----
If you have Myanmar3 AND Zawgyi-One installed, you'll probably have to hack it so Myanmar3 is used for SCIM. The best way I've found to do this is to copy local.conf from the scim-waitzar source directory to /etc/fonts 
I added a few lines to this file to clean up your display and to properly order fonts for Chinese. You can comment them out if you don't like it.

NOTE:
----
my_MM will eventually need to be copied into /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ but for now this is not necessary.


Debian package making instructions
----------------------------------
In general:
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
...is supposed to work. I haven't verified it across all architectures, though, and right now the project doesn't sign anything. I need to fully read:
http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/index.en.html#contents
...at some point.

dpkg-buildpackage -ai386 -rfakeroot
...might also be necessary.

...for me:
dpkg-buildpackage -i -rfakeroot -ksorlok_reaves@yahoo.com


Some useful checks:
lintian -I -E package-version.changes
sudo piuparts binpackage-version.deb

Finally:
dpkg-scanpackages . override.txt | gzip -9c > Packages.gz
dpkg-scansources . override.txt | gzip -9c > Sources.gz
